### Introduction
This Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement is a response to Section
54(1), Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and relates to actions and activities
for the financial year ending 31 December 2021.

Redefine Technologies ('the Company', 'we', 'us' or 'our') is committed to
preventing slavery and human trafficking violations in its own operations,
its supply chain, and its products. We have zero-tolerance towards slavery and
require our supply chain to comply with our values.

### Organisational structure
Redefine Technologies has business operations in the United Kingdom. We operate
in the technology sector. The nature of our supply chains is as follows: We work
with a number of key direct suppliers, who provide us with services, such as
outsourced business processes and IT software.

### Due Diligence
As part of our efforts to monitor and reduce the risk of slavery and human
trafficking occurring in our supply chains, we have adopted the following due
diligence procedures:
- Internal supplier audits.
- External supplier audits.

Our due diligence procedures aim to:
- Identify and action potential risks in our business and supply chains.
- Monitor potential risks in our business and supply chains
- Reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our business and
  supply chains.

### Risk and compliance
The Company has evaluated the nature and extent of its exposure to the risk of
slavery and human trafficking occurring in its UK supply chain through:
- Evaluating the slavery and human trafficking risks of each new supplier.

We do not consider that we operate in a high-risk environment because the
majority of our supply chain is based in the UK and in a low-risk industry.

We do not tolerate slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains.
Where there is evidence of failure to comply with our procedures by any of our
suppliers, we will seek to terminate our relationship with that supplier immediately.

### Effectiveness

We cannot say with any certainty how effective the steps we are taking have been
in ensuring that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our business
and supply chains. As part of our work for the next financial year, we will be
creating an annual risk profile for key suppliers.
